Average Buffer Occupancy for the entire time

Turn off Idle Virtual Channels

Ordering in virtual channels can no longer be ensured
If a virtual plane experiences lower contention, it will route it's data faster
than the virtual plane that experiences contention even if the packets are set off later.

Make NodeVerifier more Robust
Make Generator for new Testbench

Make a Congestion aware NoC. Congestion detection signal can be sent beside ready to tell
the sender if there is congestion in this VC.
If some other VC has no congestion, then packets should preferably be routed to that VC.
We can even have multi bit congestion detection to relay the severity of congestion.

How do non-head packets know where to route in wormhole? Body and tail are also given some bits to identify 
the destination, wouldn't more packets be required to transfer the same amount of data?

Buffer Management needs to be changed. Currently, the system is Handshake based so the Valid signal has
to traverse the entire link and consequently, Ready signal also has to travel the entire link before even
a single flit is sent. This will mess up the critical path. Better would be to use Credit based and On/Off.
These 3 types of Buffer Management systems can be provided in the library.
